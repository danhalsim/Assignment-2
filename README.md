# Professional Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio website that will showcase my projects and accomplishments as a coding student. I built this project so that future employers will be able to see my work and the experience that I've gathered.

In building this project, I learned how to set up a simple website by using HTML, then to style it using CSS.
